# worldbuilder-engine

The generator core. One implementation, compiled twice: natively for Evennia and maritime
through Python bindings, and to WebAssembly for the browser studio.

Slice 0 measured that those two targets agree bit-for-bit over 5,000,000 samples, with a
negative control proving the comparison could detect a one-bit difference. That is the
foundation this crate is built on; see `spikes/0-bit-equality/README.md`.

## What is here so far

    src/detmath.rs   the only place a transcendental is called
    src/vectors.rs   Vec3
    src/sphere.rs    SpherePoint
    src/bindings.rs  the PyO3 surface, conversion only

The Python in `worldbuilder/` is still the reference implementation and is unchanged.
Nothing has been deleted, and the engine is additive until conformance is established for
every module.

## Two rules that are not style

**No std maths.** Everything transcendental routes through `detmath`, backed by the
pure-Rust `libm`. `tests/no_std_math.rs` fails the build if a std float method appears
outside that file, and the guard has been observed to fail, not merely to pass.

**Floor, never cast.** `worldbuilder/terrain/noise.py` derives lattice cells with
`int(x // 1)`, which floors toward negative infinity; Rust's `as i64` truncates toward
zero. For any negative coordinate they select a different cell, silently. Use
`detmath::floor`. `tests/no_std_math.rs` bans `as i64`/`as i32`/`as u64`/`as u32` outright,
with a `// cast-ok: <reason>` escape hatch for casts that are genuinely integer-to-integer
and not a float truncation -- so this is mechanised the same way the no-std-maths rule is,
not merely documented.

## Building it

    cd crates/worldbuilder-engine
    python -m maturin develop --release

## Conformance

The suite at `tests/test_conformance.py` compares this crate against the Python
implementation it ports, and holds it to two different contracts depending on what is in
a function's path.

**Strict, bit-for-bit, where no transcendental is involved.** All of `Vec3` -- length,
cross, and normalised, including the zero-vector case, where Rust returns `None` and
Python raises `ValueError` -- agrees exactly across a 20,000-sample corpus (hashed, not
gridded, plus the poles and the axes pinned in by hand). No tolerance is used, because a
tolerance would let a coastline move by a metre and call it equal.

**Bounded to 4 ULP, where a transcendental is in the path.** `sphere_from_latlon`,
`sphere_to_latlon`, `sphere_angle_to`, and `sphere_distance_to` all route through `sin`,
`cos`, or `atan2`. Bit-identity with the Python here is not achievable and is not being
pursued: CPython's `math.sin`, `cos`, and `atan2` delegate to the platform C library --
UCRT on Windows, glibc on Linux -- while this engine deliberately uses the pure-Rust
`libm` crate instead, so that its native and WebAssembly builds agree bit-for-bit with
each other. That native/WASM agreement is what slice 0 measured over 5,000,000 samples,
and the whole studio architecture depends on it. The two goals are mutually exclusive:
matching CPython exactly would mean taking the platform libm into Rust and giving up
native/WASM equality.

The bound is measured, not assumed. Across a dense sweep the worst observed divergence
is 3 ULP, at lat=-53 lon=-45: `angle_to` worst 1 ULP, `from_latlon.z` 1, `from_latlon.x`
2, `to_latlon` lat and lon 2, `from_latlon.y` 3 (a product of two 1-ULP values).
Isolating `sin` alone, only 2 of 181 integer latitudes differ at all. 4 ULP leaves one
ULP of headroom over the worst case observed. A bound this tight still catches
structural errors -- substituting `acos` for `atan2` in `angle_to`, or reordering a
cross product, would diverge by orders of magnitude more, not by one or two extra ULP.

Every per-function figure quoted above is defended by a test, not just quoted in this
file: `test_transcendental_divergence_stays_within_its_measured_bound_for_every_sphere_function`
sweeps `from_latlon`, `to_latlon`, `angle_to`, and `distance_to` independently, tracks a
worst-ULP-per-function, asserts zero unmeasurable comparisons (NaN, infinity, or a
sign-straddle) for each, and names the function in its failure message so a regression
says which one moved.

**What this means for generator identity.** The Rust core is not a bit-exact
reimplementation of the Python; it is a new generator version under VERSION-001. Mark
1's measured world figures describe the Python generator and will need re-measuring once
the port completes.

**Open question, not yet measured.** Because CPython inherits the platform's libm, the
existing Python generator very likely already produces subtly different worlds on
Windows versus Linux. This has not been measured -- it would require running the Python
suite on Linux and comparing against a Windows run -- so treat it as a hypothesis, not a
finding.

Run it with:

    python -m pytest tests/test_conformance.py -v

252 tests pass in the full suite (240 pre-existing plus 12 conformance tests). The
harness includes a test asserting that `same` can distinguish a one-bit difference and a
test asserting that `close_enough` rejects a difference past the ULP bound, because a
conformance suite that cannot fail proves nothing.
