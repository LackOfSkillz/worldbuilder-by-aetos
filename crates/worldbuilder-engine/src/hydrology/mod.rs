//! Automatic water: the bake that finds where water collects and where it runs.
//!
//! See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-10-automatic-water-design.md`. This module reads the
//! landform (`Surface::structural_m`), never the detail noise, and it changes nothing in the
//! default elevation path: a bake is requested, not implied.
