"""
Conformance between the Python reference and the Rust engine.

The engine is not a rewrite that should behave similarly. It is a port, and this file
holds it to two different contracts depending on what is in a function's path.

Anything with no transcendental in it (Vec3: length, cross, normalised) must agree
bit-for-bit -- comparison is on raw f64 bit patterns, never a tolerance, because a
tolerance would let a coastline move by a metre and call it equal. Anything whose path
includes a transcendental (sin, cos, atan2, by way of the sphere functions) is bounded
to MAX_TRANSCENDENTAL_ULPS instead, because Python's math module and Rust's `libm` crate
are two independently-rounded implementations that are permitted, and measured, to
differ by a few bits. See MAX_TRANSCENDENTAL_ULPS below for why that split exists and
where the bound comes from.

Skips wholesale if the engine is not built, so the Python suite still runs on a machine
with no Rust.

"""
Why these are not bit-for-bit, when the Vec3 tests are.

Python's math.sin, cos and atan2 delegate to the platform C library -- UCRT on
Windows, glibc on Linux. The Rust engine deliberately uses the pure-Rust `libm`
crate instead, so that its native and WebAssembly builds agree bit-for-bit; that
equality was measured over 5,000,000 samples and the studio depends on it.

Those two choices are mutually exclusive. Matching CPython exactly would mean
taking the platform libm into Rust and giving up native/WASM equality, which is
the foundation of the architecture. So the engine is a new generator version
rather than a bit-exact reimplementation, and this bound is what "the port is
structurally correct" means for a path containing a transcendental.

The bound is measured, not guessed: the worst observed divergence across a dense
sweep is 3 ULP (from_latlon's y component, a product of two 1-ULP values), with
sin alone differing on 2 of 181 integer latitudes. 4 leaves one ULP of headroom.

A bound this tight still catches structural errors. Substituting acos for atan2
in angle_to, or reordering a cross product, moves results by far more than 4 ULP.
